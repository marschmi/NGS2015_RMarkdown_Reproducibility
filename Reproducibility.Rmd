# As scientists, it should be our goal to perform **robust** and **reproducible** research.

- **Robust research** is void of *silent errors* (unknown) software bugs and messy data.  
    + **Silent errors**: Code and programs may produce output, rather than stop with an error, but this output may be incorrect.  
- **Reproducible research** may be repeated by other researchers with the same results. 

####What are the ingredients to robust and reproducible research?  

- **Work must be well documented!  Methods, code, and data must be made available to others!**  
- Adopt a cautious attitude and *check everything*.    
    + Vince Buffalo's golden rule of bioinformatics:  "Never ever trust your tools (or data)"  
    + Remember, "garbage in, garbage out" - an analysis is only as good as the data going in.

However, the size of our data and the complexity of our analysis workflows make it difficult to be truly reproducible.  

1. Genomics data is too large and high dimensional to easily inspect or visualize.  Usually, workflows involve multiple steps and it's not feasible to inspect every step.  
2. Unlike in the wet lab, we don't always know what to expect of our genomics data analysis.  
3. It's difficult to distinguish *good* from *bad* results.

What's the benefit for *you*?  

Yeah, it takes a lot of effort to be robust and reproducible.  However, *it will make your life (and science) easier!*

# Recommendations for Robust Research
### Pay attention to Experimental Design 

#### Write code for humans, write data for computers

#### Let your computer do the work for you

#### Make assertions and be loud, in code and in your methods

### Use existing libraries (packages) whenever possible

### Treat data as read-only

### Spend time developing frequently used scripts into tools

### Let data prove that it's high quality

# Recommendations for reproducible research 

### Release your code and data

### Document everything, including software versions and command line arguments exactly

Include “session info” in your document, preferably at the bottom. Session info lists the version of R that you’re using plus all of the packages you’ve loaded. There’s a sessionInfo() that’s included with base R (in the utils package), but [Dr. Karl Broman](http://kbroman.org/knitr_knutshell/pages/reproducible.html) recommends using the `session_info()` from the devtools package as it provides more detailed information in a nicer layout.

### Make figures and statistics the results of scripts 

### Use code as documentation

### Write code that uses relative paths.

Do not rely on hard-coded absolute paths (i.e. /Users/marschmi/Data/seq-data.csv or even ~/Data/seq-data.csv). Relative paths (i.e. Data/seq-data.csv) or command line arguments are better alternatives.

### Encapsulate the full project into one directory

### Set your seed  

If there is any randomizations of data or simulations, use `set.seed()` in the first code chunk.


Dr. Karl Browman suggests to open R and type runif(1, 0, 10^8) and then paste the resulting large number into set.seed() in the first code chunk. If you do this, then the random aspects of your analysis should be repeated the same way exactly whenever it is “knit.”
