Today, I learned about reproducibility.  The first thing I should do, is set my seed.

```{r Set Seed, eval=TRUE, echo=TRUE}
#runif(1, 0, 1^8)
set.seed(seed = 43855096)
```

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
